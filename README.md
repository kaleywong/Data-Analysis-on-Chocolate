GitHub Project Summary: Data Analysis on Chocolate Sales
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing chocolate sales to uncover insights and trends. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the analysis covers data cleaning, sales trends, customer preferences, and seasonal patterns. The goal is to understand which chocolate products sell best, when they sell, and what factors might influence those trends.

Key highlights:

Cleaned and formatted the dataset, including converting date fields and checking for missing or duplicated data.

Visualized total sales by product category and region.

Explored monthly and seasonal trends in chocolate purchases.

Identified top-performing products and customer segments.

This analysis can help stakeholders make data-driven decisions regarding inventory planning, marketing campaigns, and product development.
